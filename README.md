<h1>A skill building project!</h1>  
<hr>
<p>This is a very basic webpage that I will try and develope into a fully functioning online store for my brother's coffee roasting business!<br>As you can see by the title of this repo, it started as a lesson in Git and Github, but I will continue to use it as a way to develope my HTML and CSS skills, later branching into Java.<br>Not open to pull requests at the moment. 🙂</p>
